        Car toys are miniature replicas or models of real automobiles designed for play and entertainment purposes. These toys are typically made from materials such as plastic, metal, or a combination of both. They come in various sizes, ranging from small die-cast models to larger scale models with intricate details.

Car toys often mimic real vehicles, including sports cars, trucks, SUVs, vintage cars, and more. They can be based on specific car brands or models, or they may represent generic designs. Some car toys are licensed replicas of actual vehicles, featuring authentic logos, decals, and paint schemes.
